## Project Description

`placeholder_files` is a simple Python project designed to demonstrate a basic application structure with modular components. It showcases authentication, configuration loading, and utility functions. This project serves as a template or starting point for more complex applications. The core functionality involves handling user login by validating credentials and generating tokens upon successful authentication.  It aims to provide a clear and concise example of how to organize code into separate modules for improved readability and maintainability.

## Main Features

*   **Authentication:** Handles user login and generates authentication tokens.
*   **Configuration Loading:** Loads application settings from a YAML file.
*   **Modular Design:**  Organized into separate modules (auth, config, utils, main) for better code management.
*   **Example Usage:** Provides a basic `main` function to demonstrate the interaction between different modules.

## Project Structure

The project directory is structured as follows:

```
placeholder_files/
├── auth.py      # Contains authentication-related functions.
├── config.py    # Contains configuration loading functions.
├── main.py      # The main entry point of the application.
├── utils.py     # Contains utility functions like credential validation and token generation.
└── config.yaml  # Example configuration file in YAML format.
└── README.md    # This file.
```

## Dependencies

This project relies on the following Python libraries:

*   **PyYAML:** Used for loading configuration data from YAML files.  Install with: `pip install pyyaml`

The dependencies are organized within the following modules:

*   **auth.py:**  Utilizes `utils.py` for validating credentials and generating tokens.
*   **config.py:**  Utilizes `pyyaml` for loading configuration from the `config.yaml` file.
*   **utils.py:**  Contains utility functions for authentication.

## How to Install and Run

1.  **Clone the repository (or download the files):**

    ```bash
    # If you're using git:
    git clone [repository_url]
    cd placeholder_files
    ```

    (Replace `[repository_url]` with the actual URL of your Git repository.)

2.  **Install the dependencies:**

    ```bash
    pip install pyyaml
    ```

3.  **Run the application:**

    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

    This will execute the `main` function in `main.py`, which loads the configuration, simulates a user login attempt, and prints the result (either a success message with a token or a failure message).

## Important Functions Summary

Here's a brief overview of the key functions in each module:

*   **`auth.py`:**
    *   `handle_login(request)`: Authenticates a user based on username and password provided in the request. If authentication is successful, it generates a token and returns a success message. Otherwise, it returns a failure message.

*   **`config.py`:**
    *   `load_config(path)`: Loads configuration data from a YAML file specified by the given path. Returns a dictionary containing the configuration.

*   **`main.py`:**
    *   `main()`:  The main entry point of the application. It loads the configuration, simulates a user login request using hardcoded credentials, and prints the result of the login attempt.

*   **`utils.py`:**
    *   `validate_credentials(username, password)`: Validates user credentials (username and password).  Returns `True` if the credentials are valid, `False` otherwise.  In this example, it performs a simple check against hardcoded "admin" credentials.
    *   `generate_token(username)`: Generates a simple authentication token based on the provided username.

## config.yaml

This example project is designed to load in a yaml file to configure the behaviour of the application. It is currently unused, but included for demonstration purposes.

```yaml
settings:
  log_level: INFO
  timeout: 30
```
